    shortDescription: The jEAP Messaging outbox provides an implementation of the Transactional Outbox pattern for jEAP-based applications.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Messaging Outbox is a library providing a robust implementation of the
      Transactional Outbox pattern for jEAP-based applications. It ensures reliable
      message delivery by persisting outgoing messages in the same database transaction
      as the associated business data changes, and dispatching them only after a successful
      commit. This eliminates the need for distributed transactions while guaranteeing
      consistency, even if the messaging system is temporarily unavailable. The outbox
      integrates with Kafka and SQL databases via JPA/JDBC, supports both immediate
      post-commit sending and scheduled background relay processing, and includes
      mechanisms for retrying or resending failed messages. It offers configurable
      housekeeping, retention policies, and extensive operational metrics through
      Micrometer to support monitoring and alerting.
    features:
      - Transactional Outbox Pattern ensuring reliable message delivery in conjunction with database transactions
      - Integration with jEAP messaging and Spring Boot
